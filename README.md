# API Project

This project is focusing on back end development. I will be implementing the use of express.js to create a functional server, building multiple dynamic endpoints using the MVC method whilst using supertest for extensive TDD.

For anyone who wishes to clone this repo, you will need to create your own environment variables to run the server locally.
The developer file names required are:
.env.test
.env.development

Create these files within the app directory and set the PGDATABASE to your db name.

For example: PGDATABASE=your_db_name_here
